    /// This is the method you are meant to use most of the time in a
    /// parallel setting where modifications may arise asynchronously
    /// (e.g., a language server). In this context, it is common to
    /// wish to "fork off" a snapshot of the database performing some
    /// series of queries in parallel and arranging the results. Using
    /// this method for that purpose ensures that those queries will
    /// see a consistent view of the database (it is also advisable
    /// for those queries to use the [`Runtime::unwind_if_cancelled`]
    /// method to check for cancellation).

    /// query. Attepting to do so will panic.

    /// # Deadlock warning
    ///
    /// The intended pattern for snapshots is that, once created, they
    /// are sent to another thread and used from there. As such, the
    /// `snapshot` acquires a "read lock" on the database --
    /// therefore, so long as the `snapshot` is not dropped, any
    /// attempt to `set` a value in the database will block. If the
    /// `snapshot` is owned by the same thread that is attempting to
    /// `set`, this will cause a problem.
    ///
    /// # How to implement this
    ///
    /// Typically, this method will create a second copy of your
    /// database type (`MyDatabaseType`, in the example below),
    /// cloning over each of the fields from `self` into this new
    /// copy. For the field that stores the salsa runtime, you should
    /// use [the `Runtime::snapshot` method][rfm] to create a snapshot of the
    /// runtime. Finally, package up the result using `Snapshot::new`,
    /// which is a simple wrapper type that only gives `&self` access
    /// to the database within (thus preventing the use of methods
    /// that may mutate the inputs):
    ///
    /// [rfm]: struct.Runtime.html#method.snapshot
    ///
    /// ```rust,ignore
    /// impl ParallelDatabase for MyDatabaseType {
    ///     fn snapshot(&self) -> Snapshot<Self> {
    ///         Snapshot::new(
    ///             MyDatabaseType {
    ///                 runtime: self.runtime.snapshot(self),
    ///                 other_field: self.other_field.clone(),
    ///             }
